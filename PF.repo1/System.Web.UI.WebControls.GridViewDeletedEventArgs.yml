  summary: Provides data for the <xref href="System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView.RowDeleted"></xref> event.
  remarks: "The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView> control raises the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView.RowDeleted> event when a Delete button (a button with its `CommandName` property set to \"Delete\") within the control is clicked, but after the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView> control deletes the record. This allows you to provide an event-handling method that performs a custom routine, such as checking the results of a delete operation, whenever this event occurs.  \n  \n A <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridViewDeletedEventArgs> object is passed to the event-handling method, which allows you to determine the number of records affected and any exceptions that might have occurred. To determine the number of records affected by the delete operation, use the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridViewDeletedEventArgs.AffectedRows%2A> property. Use the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridViewDeletedEventArgs.Exception%2A> property to determine whether any exceptions occurred. You can also indicate whether the exception was handled in the event-handling method by setting the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridViewDeletedEventArgs.ExceptionHandled%2A> property.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  If an exception occurs during the delete operation and the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridViewDeletedEventArgs.ExceptionHandled%2A> property is set to `false`, the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView> control re-throws the exception.  \n  \n If you want to access the name/value pairs of the key fields and non-key fields of the deleted record, use the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridViewDeletedEventArgs.Keys%2A> and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridViewDeletedEventArgs.Values%2A> properties, respectively.  \n  \n For more information about handling events, see [NIB: Consuming Events](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/01e4f1bc-e55e-413f-98c7-6588493e5f67)."

  summary: Gets the number of rows affected by the delete operation.
  remarks: "Use the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridViewDeletedEventArgs.AffectedRows%2A> property to determine the number of records affected by the delete operation. This property is commonly used to verify that the correct number of records was deleted in the following situations:  \n  \n-   Verify that only a single record was deleted. Sometimes an improperly written delete statement can delete multiple records.  \n  \n-   Verify that a record was deleted when an error occurs during the delete operation that does not raise an exception.  \n  \n-   Verify that a record was deleted when a data source control that supports optimistic concurrency (such as the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.SqlDataSource> and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.ObjectDataSource> controls) has its <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.SqlDataSource.ConflictDetection%2A> property set to the `ConflictOptions.CompareAllValues` enumeration value. Under this setting, a record that has been modified by another user concurrently might not be deleted."
