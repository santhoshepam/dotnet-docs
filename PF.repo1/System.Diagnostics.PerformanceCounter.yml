  summary: Represents a Windows NT performance counter component.
  remarks: "The <xref:System.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounter> component can be used for both reading existing predefined or custom counters and publishing (writing) performance data to custom counters.  \n  \n There are numerous predefined counters listed in the Windows Performance Monitor's [Add Counters dialog box](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=257854). To learn about the .NET Framework performance counters, see [Performance Counters](~/docs/framework/debug-trace-profile/performance-counters.md).  \n  \n This type implements the <xref:System.IDisposable> interface. When you have finished using the type, you should dispose of it either directly or indirectly. To dispose of the type directly, call its <xref:System.IDisposable.Dispose%2A> method in a `try`/`catch` block. To dispose of it indirectly, use a language construct such as `using` (in C#) or `Using` (in Visual Basic). For more information, see the \"Using an Object that Implements IDisposable\" section in the <xref:System.IDisposable> interface topic.  \n  \n> [!IMPORTANT]\n>  In versions 1.0 and 1.1 of the .NET Framework, this class requires immediate callers to be fully trusted. Starting with the .NET Framework version 2.0, this class requires <xref:System.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounterPermission> for specific actions. It is strongly recommended that <xref:System.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounterPermission> not be granted to semi-trusted code.  The ability to read and write performance counters allows code to perform actions such as enumerating executing processes and obtaining information about them.  \n>   \n>  In addition, passing a <xref:System.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounter> object to less-trusted code can create a security issue. Never pass performance counter objects, such as a <xref:System.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounterCategory> or <xref:System.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounter>, to less trusted code.  \n  \n To read from a performance counter, create an instance of the <xref:System.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounter> class, set the <xref:System.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounter.CategoryName%2A>, <xref:System.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounter.CounterName%2A>, and, optionally, the <xref:System.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounter.InstanceName%2A> or <xref:System.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounter.MachineName%2A> properties, and then call the <xref:System.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounter.NextValue%2A> method to take a performance counter reading.  \n  \n To publish performance counter data, create one or more custom counters using the <xref:System.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounterCategory.Create%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method, create an instance of the <xref:System.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounter> class, set the <xref:System.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounter.CategoryName%2A>, <xref:System.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounter.CounterName%2A> and, optionally, <xref:System.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounter.InstanceName%2A> or <xref:System.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounter.MachineName%2A> properties, and then call the <xref:System.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounter.IncrementBy%2A>, <xref:System.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounter.Increment%2A>, or <xref:System.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounter.Decrement%2A> methods, or set the <xref:System.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounter.RawValue%2A> property to change the value of your custom counter.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  The <xref:System.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounter.Increment%2A>, <xref:System.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounter.IncrementBy%2A>, and <xref:System.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounter.Decrement%2A> methods use interlocks to update the counter value. This helps keep the counter value accurate in multithreaded or multiprocess scenarios, but also results in a performance penalty. If you do not need the accuracy that interlocked operations provide, you can update the <xref:System.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounter.RawValue%2A> property directly for up to a 5 times performance improvement.  However, in multithreaded scenarios, some updates to the counter value might be ignored, resulting in inaccurate data.  \n  \n The counter is the mechanism by which performance data is collected. The registry stores the names of all the counters, each of which is related to a specific area of system functionality. Examples include a processor's busy time, memory usage, or the number of bytes received over a network connection.  \n  \n Each counter is uniquely identified through its name and its location. In the same way that a file path includes a drive, a directory, one or more subdirectories, and a file name, counter information consists of four elements: the computer, the category, the category instance, and the counter name.  \n  \n The counter information must include the category, or performance object, that the counter measures data for. A computer's categories include physical components, such as processors, disks, and memory. There are also system categories, such as processes and threads. Each category is related to a functional element within the computer and has a set of standard counters assigned to it. These objects are listed in the Performance object drop-down list of the Add Counters dialog box within the Windows 2000 System Monitor, and you must include them in the counter path. Performance data is grouped by the category to which is it related.  \n  \n In certain cases, several copies of the same category can exist. For example, several processes and threads run simultaneously, and some computers contain more than one processor. The category copies are called category instances, and each instance has a set of standard counters assigned to it. If a category can have more than one instance, an instance specification must be included in the counter information.  \n  \n To obtain performance data for counters that required an initial or previous value for performing the necessary calculation, call the <xref:System.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounter.NextValue%2A> method twice and use the information returned as your application requires.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  Performance counter categories installed with the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnlong](~/includes/dnprdnlong-md.md)] use separate shared memory, with each performance counter category having its own memory. You can specify the size of separate shared memory by creating a DWORD named FileMappingSize in the registry key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\\\*\\<category name>*\\Performance. The FileMappingSize value is set to the shared memory size of the category. The default size is 131072 decimal. If the FileMappingSize value is not present, the `fileMappingSize` attribute value for the `performanceCounters` element specified in the Machine.config file is used, causing additional overhead for configuration file processing. You can realize a performance improvement for application startup by setting the file mapping size in the registry. For more information about the file mapping size, see [\\&lt;performanceCounters\\&gt;](~/docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/trace-debug/performancecounters-element.md)."
  example:
  - "The following code example demonstrates the use of the <xref:System.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounter> class to create and use an <xref:System.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounterType.AverageCount64> counter type. The example creates categories, sets up counters, collects data from the counters, and calls the <xref:System.Diagnostics.CounterSampleCalculator> class to interpret the performance counter data. The intermediate and final results are displayed in the console window. For additional examples of other performance counter types, see the <xref:System.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounterType> enumeration.  \n  \n [!code-cpp[PerformanceCounterType.AverageCounter64#1](~/samples/snippets/cpp/VS_Snippets_CLR/PerformanceCounterType.AverageCounter64/CPP/averagecount32.cpp#1)]\n [!code-csharp[PerformanceCounterType.AverageCounter64#1](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR/PerformanceCounterType.AverageCounter64/CS/averagecount32.cs#1)]\n [!code-vb[PerformanceCounterType.AverageCounter64#1](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR/PerformanceCounterType.AverageCounter64/VB/averagecount32.vb#1)]"

  summary: Gets or sets the name of the performance counter category for this performance counter.
  remarks: "The <xref:System.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounter.CategoryName%2A> is displayed in the `Performance Object` field of Performance Counter Manager MMC snap in's `Add Counter` dialog box.  \n  \n A performance counter monitors the behavior of a category, or performance object, on a computer. Categories include physical components (such as processors, disks, and memory) and system objects (such as processes and threads). System counters that are related to the same performance object are grouped into a category that indicates their common focus. When you create an instance of the <xref:System.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounter> class, you first indicate the category with which the component will interact, and then you choose a counter from that category.  \n  \n For example, one Windows counter category is the Memory category. System counters within this category track memory data such as the number of bytes available and the number of bytes cached. If you wanted to work with the bytes cached in your application, you would create an instance of the <xref:System.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounter> component, connect it to the Memory category, and then pick the appropriate counter (in this case, Cached Bytes) from that category.  \n  \n Although your system makes many more counter categories available, the categories that you will probably interact with most frequently are the Cache, Memory, Objects, PhysicalDisk, Process, Processor, Server, System, and Thread categories."
  example:
  - "The following code example creates a default instance of the <xref:System.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounter> class. After the instance is created, the <xref:System.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounter.CategoryName%2A>, <xref:System.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounter.CounterName%2A>, and <xref:System.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounter.InstanceName%2A> property values are set, and the results of a call to the <xref:System.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounter.NextValue%2A> method are displayed.  \n  \n [!code-cpp[PerfCounter#1](~/samples/snippets/cpp/VS_Snippets_CLR/PerfCounter/CPP/perfcounter.cpp#1)]\n [!code-csharp[PerfCounter#1](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR/PerfCounter/CS/perfcounter.cs#1)]\n [!code-vb[PerfCounter#1](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR/PerfCounter/VB/perfcounter.vb#1)]"

  summary: Gets or sets an instance name for this performance counter.
  remarks: "> [!NOTE]\n>  Instance names must be shorter than 128 characters in length.  \n  \n In some situations, categories are subdivided into instances, which track data about multiple occurrences of the object that a category relates to. Instances apply to the category as whole, rather than to individual counters. Every counter within a category has each instance defined for the category. For example, the Process category contains instances named Idle and System. Every counter within the Process category thus contains data for each instance, showing information about either idle processes or system processes.  \n  \n Many categories do not contain multiple instances, so you can leave this property empty to indicate that no instance is associated with the category.  \n  \n If this <xref:System.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounter> instance points to a noncustom category, you can choose from only the existing category instances. You can create new category instances only in custom categories, which allow you to define as many counters and category instances as you need.  \n  \n To create a performance category instance, specify an `instanceName` on the <xref:System.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounter.%23ctor%2A> constructor. If the category instance specified by `instanceName` already exists the new object will reference the existing category instance.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  Do not use the characters \"(\", \")\", \"#\", \"\\\\\", or \"/\" in the instance name. If any of these characters are used, the Performance Console (see [Runtime Profiling](~/docs/framework/debug-trace-profile/runtime-profiling.md)) may not correctly display the instance values.  \n  \n If the instance name is automatically generated and might contain the characters \"(\", \")\", \"#\", \"\\\\\", or \"/\", use the character mapping in the following table.  \n  \n|Character|Mapped character|  \n|---------------|----------------------|  \n|(|[|  \n|)|]|  \n|#|_|  \n|\\|_|  \n|/|_|  \n  \n The <xref:System.AppDomain.FriendlyName%2A> property of the <xref:System.AppDomain> object obtained from the <xref:System.AppDomain.CurrentDomain%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property is a common source of instance names that can contain invalid characters."

  summary: Gets or sets the raw, or uncalculated, value of this counter.
  remarks: "If the counter type is a 32-bit size and you attempt to set this property to a value that is too large to fit, the property truncates the value to 32 bits. When reading custom counters on the local computer, using the <xref:System.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounter.RawValue%2A> property rather than a calculated value can produce significantly better performance in scenarios where the raw value is sufficient.  \n  \n If the counter that you are reading is read-only, getting the <xref:System.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounter.RawValue%2A> property samples the counter at the time that the property is called. This action is equivalent to making an initial call to the <xref:System.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounter.NextSample%2A> method. If you subsequently call <xref:System.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounter.NextSample%2A>, you can perform calculations on the values that both calls returned.  \n  \n Because system counters are read-only, you can get but not set their raw values.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  The <xref:System.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounter.Increment%2A>, <xref:System.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounter.IncrementBy%2A>, and <xref:System.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounter.Decrement%2A> methods use interlocks to update the counter value. This helps keep the counter value accurate in multithreaded or multiprocess scenarios, but also results in a performance penalty. If you do not need the accuracy that interlocked operations provide, you can update the <xref:System.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounter.RawValue%2A> property directly for up to a 5 times performance improvement.  However, in multithreaded scenarios, some updates to the counter value might be ignored, resulting in inaccurate data.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  If the value for the <xref:System.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounter.InstanceLifetime%2A> property is <xref:System.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounterInstanceLifetime.Process> and the performance counter category was created with .NET Framework version 1.0 or 1.1, an <xref:System.InvalidOperationException> is thrown.

  remarks: "You can remove an instance only for a custom counter. All system counters are read-only, so attempting to remove one of them throws an exception.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  To avoid a possible race condition when the performance counter shared memory is released, it is recommended that the <xref:System.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounter.RemoveInstance%2A> method be called from the <xref:System.AppDomain.DomainUnload> event handler.  \n  \n To create a performance category instance, specify an `instanceName` on the <xref:System.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounter.%23ctor%2A> constructor. If the category instance specified by `instanceName` already exists the new object will reference the existing category instance.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  If the value for the <xref:System.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounter.InstanceLifetime%2A> property is <xref:System.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounterInstanceLifetime.Process> and the performance counter category was created with .NET Framework version 1.0 or 1.1, an <xref:System.InvalidOperationException> is thrown. Performance counter categories created with earlier versions use global shared memory, and the value for <xref:System.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounter.InstanceLifetime%2A> must be <xref:System.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounterInstanceLifetime.Global>. If the category is not used by applications running on versions 1.0 or 1.1 of the .NET Framework, delete and recreate the category."
