  summary: Represents the method that will handle the <xref href="System.Windows.Input.CommandBinding.Executed"></xref> and <xref href="System.Windows.Input.CommandBinding.PreviewExecuted"></xref> routed events, as well as related attached events.
  remarks: "This delegate contains the implementation logic for a <xref:System.Windows.Input.RoutedCommand>.  Separating the implementation logic from the command allows the command to be invoked from different sources and types, and enables the centralization of command logic.  \n  \n This delegate is also used for <xref:System.Windows.Input.CommandManager.Executed?displayProperty=fullName> and <xref:System.Windows.Input.CommandManager.PreviewExecuted?displayProperty=fullName>, which are attached events on the <xref:System.Windows.Input.CommandManager> class that implements much of the commanding infrastructure. But most practical handlers will handle the <xref:System.Windows.Input.CommandBinding.Executed> events from a particular <xref:System.Windows.Input.CommandBinding>, rather than work at the <xref:System.Windows.Input.CommandManager> level.  \n  \n Within <xref:System.Windows.Input.ExecutedRoutedEventArgs>, the following properties are generally of interest when you write an event handler for a routed event that results from an executed command:  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.RoutedEventArgs.Source%2A> reports the target where the command was executed. Once the command is executed, you can also think of the <xref:System.Windows.RoutedEventArgs.Source%2A> more generally in routed event terms, as the object that raised a routed event.  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Input.ExecutedRoutedEventArgs.Command%2A> reports the command that executed. This property is useful if you use command bindings and if you write handlers that potentially handle multiple commands.  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Input.ExecutedRoutedEventArgs.Parameter%2A> reports any command-specific parameters that were passed by the executing command. Not all commands use or expect command-specific parameters.  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.RoutedEventArgs.Handled%2A> reports whether the routed event that resulted from the executed command was already handled by a different element along the route. For routed event handlers, it is a recommended practice to have handlers that do meaningful work when handling the event to set <xref:System.Windows.RoutedEventArgs.Handled%2A> to `true`. This prevents typical handlers for the event from handling the event again further along the route. For more information on handling routed events, see [Marking Routed Events as Handled, and Class Handling](~/docs/framework/wpf/advanced/marking-routed-events-as-handled-and-class-handling.md).  \n  \n This delegate also represents handlers for <xref:System.Windows.Input.CommandManager.Executed?displayProperty=fullName> and <xref:System.Windows.Input.CommandManager.PreviewExecutedEvent?displayProperty=fullName>, which are attached events on the <xref:System.Windows.Input.CommandManager> class that implements much of the commanding infrastructure. But most practical handlers will handle the <xref:System.Windows.Input.CommandBinding.Executed> events from a particular <xref:System.Windows.Input.CommandBinding>, rather than work at the <xref:System.Windows.Input.CommandManager> level.  \n  \n For more information on commanding, see [Commanding Overview](~/docs/framework/wpf/advanced/commanding-overview.md)."
  example:
  - "This example creates an <xref:System.Windows.Input.ExecutedRoutedEventHandler> that sets a visual property on the target when the command is executed. The example also includes the <xref:System.Windows.Input.CanExecuteRoutedEventHandler> for the same command.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[Custom_RoutedCommand#Custom_RoutedCommandHandlers](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/Custom_RoutedCommand/CSharp/Window1.xaml.cs#custom_routedcommandhandlers)]\n [!code-vb[Custom_RoutedCommand#Custom_RoutedCommandHandlers](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/Custom_RoutedCommand/visualbasic/window1.xaml.vb#custom_routedcommandhandlers)]"
