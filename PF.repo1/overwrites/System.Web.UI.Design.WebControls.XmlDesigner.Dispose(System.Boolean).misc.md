<p>When overriding `Dispose(Boolean)`, because the `Dispose` method can be called multiple times by other objects, be careful not to reference objects that have been previously disposed of in an earlier call to the `Dispose` method. For more information about how to implement `Dispose(Boolean)`, see [Implementing a Dispose Method](~/docs/standard/garbage-collection/implementing-dispose.md)
