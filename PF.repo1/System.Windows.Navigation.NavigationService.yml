  summary: Contains methods, properties, and events to support navigation.
  remarks: "<xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService> encapsulates the ability to download content within the context of a browser-style navigation.  \n  \n Content can be any type of [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winfx](~/includes/tla2sharptla-winfx-md.md)] object and [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_html](~/includes/tlasharptla-html-md.md)] files. In general, however, pages are the preferred as the way to package content for navigation (see <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Page>).  \n  \n Content can be navigated to by providing an instance of an object and calling an overload of the <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.Navigate%2A> method that accepts an object:  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.Navigate%28System.Object%29?displayProperty=fullName>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.Navigate%28System.Object%2CSystem.Object%29?displayProperty=fullName>  \n  \n Alternatively, content can be navigated to by passing a relative or absolute [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_uri](~/includes/tlasharptla-uri-md.md)] to one of the <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.Navigate%2A> method overloads that accepts a [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uri](~/includes/tla2sharptla-uri-md.md)]:  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.Navigate%28System.Uri%29?displayProperty=fullName>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.Navigate%28System.Uri%2CSystem.Object%29?displayProperty=fullName>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.Navigate%28System.Uri%2CSystem.Object%2CSystem.Boolean%29?displayProperty=fullName>  \n  \n When content is navigated to by [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uri](~/includes/tla2sharptla-uri-md.md)], <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService> will return an object that contains the content.  \n  \n The lifetime of a navigation can be tracked through the following events:  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.Navigating>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.Navigated>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.NavigationProgress>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.NavigationFailed>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.NavigationStopped>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.LoadCompleted>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.FragmentNavigation>.  \n  \n Not all events are raised each time that a navigation occurs; the set of events that are raised is determined by the type of navigation that occurs (content or content fragment) and how the navigation completes (canceled, stopped, or failed).  \n  \n The following figure illustrates the sequence in which these events are raised:  \n  \n ![Page navigation flow chart](~/add/media/navigationoverviewfigure11.png \"Page navigation flow chart\")  \n  \n During or after a navigation, <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService> provides information about the content that is being navigated to, including the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uri](~/includes/tla2sharptla-uri-md.md)] of the content being navigated to (<xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.Source%2A>), the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uri](~/includes/tla2sharptla-uri-md.md)] of the current content (<xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.CurrentSource%2A>), and an object that contains the content that was navigated to (<xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.Content%2A>).  \n  \n When content is navigated to, <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService> records the navigation as an entry in navigation history. An entry is added to back navigation history when either a new navigation occurs, by calling the <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.Navigate%2A> method, or by navigating to an entry in forward navigation history, by calling <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.GoForward%2A>. An entry is added to forward navigation history by navigating to an entry in back navigation history, by calling <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.GoBack%2A>. <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.CanGoBack%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.CanGoForward%2A> report whether there are entries in back and forward navigation history, respectively. Also, the most recent entry in back navigation history can be removed by calling <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.RemoveBackEntry%2A>.  \n  \n By default, <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService> does not store an instance of a content object in navigation history. Instead, <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService> creates a new instance of the content object each time it is navigated to by using navigation history. This behavior is designed to avoid excessive memory consumption when large numbers and large pieces of content are being navigated to. Consequently, the state of the content is not remembered from one navigation to the next. However, [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_wpf](~/includes/tla2sharptla-wpf-md.md)] provides several techniques by which you can store a piece of state for a piece of content in navigation history.  \n  \n Using <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.AddBackEntry%2A>, you can also remember multiple sets of state for a single page instance.  \n  \n <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService> is `sealed` class and, therefore, cannot be instantiated; instead, <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService> is used by navigators to enable navigation. In [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_wpf](~/includes/tla2sharptla-wpf-md.md)], there are two navigators: <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationWindow>, <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Frame>.  \n  \n Visually, [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xbap#plural](~/includes/tla2sharptla-xbapsharpplural-md.md)] use [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ie7](~/includes/tla2sharptla-ie7-md.md)] as a navigator, to provide an integrated user experience. Physically, however, [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xbap#plural](~/includes/tla2sharptla-xbapsharpplural-md.md)] actually use <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationWindow> as the navigator; the <xref:System.Windows.Application.MainWindow%2A> property of an [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xbap](~/includes/tla2sharptla-xbap-md.md)] running in [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ie7](~/includes/tla2sharptla-ie7-md.md)] will return a reference to the <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationWindow>, and the navigation history that is managed by the <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationWindow> is integrated with the navigation history that is managed by [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ie7](~/includes/tla2sharptla-ie7-md.md)] in the following ways:  \n  \n-   When content is navigated to by calling <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.Navigate%2A>, <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.GoBack%2A>, and <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.GoForward%2A> from within an [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xbap](~/includes/tla2sharptla-xbap-md.md)] the relevant navigation history entries are also added to [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ie7](~/includes/tla2sharptla-ie7-md.md)] navigation history.  \n  \n-   When entries in the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ie7](~/includes/tla2sharptla-ie7-md.md)] navigation [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](~/includes/tla2sharptla-ui-md.md)] are selected, [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ie7](~/includes/tla2sharptla-ie7-md.md)] causes <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService> to navigate back or forwards to the content that is associated with those entries.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  A <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Frame> can provide its own navigation history, or use the navigation history of the navigator that hosts it. If <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Frame> provides its own navigation history, it can display its own navigation [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](~/includes/tla2sharptla-ui-md.md)] to navigate through the entries in navigation history; those entries are not added to the navigation history of the host navigator (<xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationWindow>, <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Frame>, [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_iegeneric](~/includes/tla2sharptla-iegeneric-md.md)]) and, consequently, cannot be navigated to from the navigation [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](~/includes/tla2sharptla-ui-md.md)] of each (see <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Frame.JournalOwnership%2A>)."

  summary: Occurs when navigation to a content fragment begins, which occurs immediately, if the desired fragment is in the current content, or after the source [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_titlexaml](~/includes/tla2sharptla-titlexaml-md.md)] content has been loaded, if the desired fragment is in different content.
  remarks: "By default, a content fragment is content that is contained by a named <xref:System.Windows.UIElement>, which is a <xref:System.Windows.UIElement> whose <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Name%2A> attribute is set, eg:  \n  \n```  \n<TextBlock Name=\"FragmentName\">...</TextBlock>  \n```  \n  \n You navigate to a [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](~/includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)] fragment by providing a [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uri](~/includes/tla2sharptla-uri-md.md)] with a suffix in the following format:  \n  \n \\#*FragmentName*  \n  \n The following shows an example of a [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uri](~/includes/tla2sharptla-uri-md.md)] that refers to a content fragment:  \n  \n `http://www.microsoft.com/targetpage.xaml#FragmentName`  \n  \n After the source page loads (after <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.LoadCompleted> event is raised), fragment navigation begins and the <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService> attempts to locate the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_titlexaml](~/includes/tla2sharptla-titlexaml-md.md)] fragment. If the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_titlexaml](~/includes/tla2sharptla-titlexaml-md.md)] fragment is found, <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService> instructs the content navigator  (<xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationWindow>, <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Frame>) to show the fragment. If you need to change this behavior, you can handle <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.FragmentNavigation> to provide your own fragment navigation behavior. <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.FragmentNavigation> is passed a <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.FragmentNavigationEventArgs> parameter which exposes properties that are useful for this purpose, including:  \n  \n-   The navigator that owns this navigation service (<xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationWindow>, <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Frame>).  \n  \n-   The fragment name.  \n  \n You can handle <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.FragmentNavigation> to override the default [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_wpf](~/includes/tla2sharptla-wpf-md.md)] fragment implementation with your own custom implementation. If you do so, you need to set <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.FragmentNavigationEventArgs.Handled%2A> to `true`; otherwise, the default [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_wpf](~/includes/tla2sharptla-wpf-md.md)] fragment processing behavior is applied.  \n  \n You should avoid directly initiating navigation from within a <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.FragmentNavigation> event handler. Since <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.FragmentNavigation> is raised during an existing navigation, initiating a new navigation from a <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.FragmentNavigation> event handler creates a nested navigation that can cause the <xref:System.ExecutionEngineException> to be thrown. Instead, you can indirectly initiate navigation by creating an asynchronous work item using the <xref:System.Windows.Threading.Dispatcher>.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  When <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService> raises <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.FragmentNavigation>, it also raises <xref:System.Windows.Application.FragmentNavigation?displayProperty=fullName> event on the <xref:System.Windows.Application> object.  \n  \n> [!IMPORTANT]\n>  Fragment navigation is not supported for loose [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](~/includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)] pages (markup-only [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](~/includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)] files with `Page` as the root element) in the following cases:  \n>   \n>  • When navigating to a fragment in a loose [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](~/includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)] page.  \n>   \n>  • When navigating from a loose [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](~/includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)] page to a fragment in another loose [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](~/includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)] page.  \n>   \n>  However, a loose [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](~/includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)] page can navigate to its own fragments."

  summary: Navigate asynchronously to source content located at a [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_uri](~/includes/tlasharptla-uri-md.md)], and pass an object that contains data to be used for processing during navigation.
  remarks: "Since navigations are asynchronous, it is possible for multiple navigations to be in progress at the same time. For example, if there are two child frames on a single page, both frames could be navigating. In this case, the various navigation events that are raised by <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService> may be raised multiple times, one for each piece of content that is being navigated to, and not necessarily in order that the navigations were requested. Consequently, if a particular navigation request needs to process data that is specific to the individual request, it cannot use data that is available to all navigation requests. Instead, you can use `navigationState` to pass data for navigation processing that is specific to one navigation request.  \n  \n The following event arguments provide access to navigation state:  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigatingCancelEventArgs.ExtraData%2A> (passed to the <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.Navigating> event).  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationEventArgs.ExtraData%2A> (passed to the <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.Navigated>, <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.NavigationStopped>, <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.LoadCompleted> event handlers)."
